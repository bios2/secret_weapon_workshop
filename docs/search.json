    "text": "Worked example\n\nData preparation – Center and scale your predictors!\nThis example uses the famous mite dataset, collected by Daniel Borcard in 1989 and included in the famous vegan package.\nSlides introducing the dataset\nFirst, we’ll load the data and do some reorganization and preparation.\n\ndata(mite, package = \"vegan\")\ndata(\"mite.env\", package = \"vegan\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(cmdstanr)\n\nThis is cmdstanr version 0.7.1\n- CmdStanR documentation and vignettes: mc-stan.org/cmdstanr\n- CmdStan path: /home/andrew/software/cmdstan\n- CmdStan version: 2.34.1\n\n# combine data and environment\nmite_data_long &lt;- bind_cols(mite.env, mite) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(Brachy:Trimalc2, names_to = \"spp\", values_to = \"abd\")\n\nBecause we’re ecologists, we’ll do one of the most classic ecological models: a Binomial GLM, modelling the presence or absence of a species based on the water content of the soil.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Presence} &\\sim \\text{Binomial}\\left(\\frac{e^a}{1 + e^a}, 1\\right) \\\\\na &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_xx\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWhere \\(x\\) is some predictor variable and \\(\\frac{e^a}{1 + e^a}\\) is the logit link function. To keep things simple and univariate, let’s consider only water for \\(x\\).\nFirst, a quick word about centering and scaling a predictor variable:\n\nI center the predictor by subtracting the mean. This changes the intercept of my linear predictor. It becomes the mean log-odds of occurrance when the water content is average\nI divide water content by 100. The dataset has units of grams per Litre of water (see ?vegan::mite.env for more details). This is fine, but I don’t think mites are able to sense differences as precise as a millimeter of water either way. by dividing by 10 I transform this into centilitres, which is more informative.\n\n\nmite_data_long_transformed &lt;- mite_data_long |&gt; \n  mutate(presabs = as.numeric(abd&gt;0),\n         # center predictors\n         water = (WatrCont - mean(WatrCont)) / 100\n         )\n\nThis makes the model:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Presence} &\\sim \\text{Binomial}\\left(\\frac{e^a}{1 + e^a}, 1\\right) \\\\\na &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_{\\text{water}}\\frac{\\text{water} - \\overline{\\text{water}}}{100}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nThe secret weapon: visually\nWe can already get a very good visual expression of the Secret Weapon approach using the power of ggplot2 and stat_smooth()\n\nmite_data_long_transformed |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = water, y = presabs)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  stat_smooth(method = \"glm\", method.args = list(family = \"binomial\")) + \n  facet_wrap(~spp)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsome things to notice about this figure:\n\nthe x-axis scale has been transformed from “grams per litre” to “centilitres away from average”\nthere is a ton of variation in how different species respond to water!\n\n\n\nThe secret weapon: in tidyverse code\n\nmite_many_glms &lt;- mite_data_long_transformed |&gt; \n  nest_by(spp) |&gt; \n  mutate(logistic_regressions = list(\n    glm(presabs ~ water,\n        family = \"binomial\",\n        data = data))) |&gt; \n  mutate(coefs = list(broom::tidy(logistic_regressions)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSplit-Apply-Combine\n\n\n\nTo explore this kind of thinking, we are going to use an approach sometimes called “split-apply-combine”\nThere are many possible ways to do this in practice. We are using a technique here from the tidyverse, which you can read more about.\n\n\n\nmite_many_glm_coefs &lt;- mite_many_glms |&gt; \n  select(-data, -logistic_regressions) |&gt; \n  unnest(coefs)\n\nmite_many_glm_coefs |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = estimate, y = spp,\n             xmin = estimate - std.error,\n             xmax = estimate + std.error)) + \n  geom_pointrange() + \n  facet_wrap(~term, scales = \"free\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, some of these estimates are high, others low. We could also plot these as histograms to see this distribution.\n\nmite_many_glm_coefs |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = estimate)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = .5) + \n  facet_wrap(~term, scales = \"free\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, the two parameters of this model represent:\n\nIntercept The probability (in log-odds) of a species being present at the average water concentration. some species are common, others are rare.\nwater this is the change in probability (in log-odds) as water increases by one centilitre per litre of substrate."
